# Education CrewAI Multi-Agent System

This project demonstrates a multi-agent system for the education industry using CrewAI. The system automates curriculum development, personalized learning, assessment creation, and research, leveraging LLMs and web tools for dynamic, up-to-date educational content generation.

## Features
- **Curriculum Development:** Automated curriculum design and updates based on the latest research.
- **Personalized Learning:** Tailored learning paths for diverse student profiles.
- **Assessment Creation:** Dynamic quiz, test, and assignment generation aligned with the curriculum.
- **Research:** Summarization and integration of the latest educational research from the web.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Specialized agents (Research Specialist, Curriculum Developer, Personalized Learning Architect, Assessment Designer) work together to deliver comprehensive educational solutions.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/education-crewai.git
   cd education-crewai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install crewai[tools]
   ```

3. **Set up API keys:**
   - Configure your LLM and web scraping API keys as needed in the notebook or via environment variables.

4. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open `Education_CrewAI.ipynb` in Jupyter and follow the instructions.

## Usage

- When prompted, enter the subject name (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence") and context (e.g., "For high school students, focus on fundamentals and applications").
- The agents will collaborate to generate a curriculum, personalized learning paths, and assessments tailored to your input.
- Review the final output in the notebook.

## Example Workflow
1. **Research Specialist** gathers the latest trends and best practices from the web.
2. **Curriculum Developer** creates a structured curriculum outline.
3. **Personalized Learning Architect** designs learning paths for different learner profiles.
4. **Assessment Designer** generates quizzes, tests, and assignments aligned with the curriculum.
